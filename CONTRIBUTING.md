## Code style

Before submitting a pull request, you should check that your changes pass the
style guidelines. To do this you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
installed.

To set up the linter, run `npm install` on the command line from the directory
containing the extension's code. This will install software (listed in
`package.json` if you want to check) which is used to perform code style
checks. Once you do this, you will not need to do it again. To upgrade the
linter, run `npm update`.

To run the linter, just run `grunt` on the command line from the directory
containing the extension's code.
